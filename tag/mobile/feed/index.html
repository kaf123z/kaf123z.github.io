				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The way we create content, consume content and exchange content has been completely disrupted by demographic shifts, social media and technological advances in a mobile-centric world. The increased appetite for on-demand content coupled with the emergence of blockchain technology creates a unique opportunity for creative talents to fully exploit their creative contributions as well as monetize their intellectual property through a completely transparent and equitable smart contract system.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Up until this time, there have been significant barriers that limit both the access to markets as well as the income generated by creative content. The power was concentrated in the hands of a few big players who had both the means to reach audiences as well as the resources to create and distribute content. The convergence of mobile, technological advancements and blockchain is unleashing a new wave of creative innovation and 18moons is at the forefront of this movement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are excited to announce the launch of 18moons Initial Coin Offering (ICO) which will expand content development and distribution opportunities through our Planet Kids platform. Our token crowdsale will bring instant utility to both the creative community as well as our end consumers, parents and kids, who will benefit from the ever-changing universe of global, local and original content that will be unlocked through the use of our tokens, Planet Kid Coins (PKC).</p>
